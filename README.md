## Example Voting App Kubernetes

This is based on the project from the Udemy course [Example Voting App Kubernetes](https://github.com/kodekloudhub/example-voting-app-kubernetes), that is at the same time a version from the original [example-voting-app](https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app) repository from the [docker-examples](https://github.com/dockersamples) GitHub page and modified it to work on the Kubernetes cluster and personalized by me.
